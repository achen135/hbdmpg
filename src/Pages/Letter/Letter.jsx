            To my mrs maam Pauline,  
            <br /><br />
            Happy Birthday!!!! You're actually uncle status now! 
            Well jokes aside, this is a huge milestone for you! 
            You're moving out the nest and you're going to be fully responsible for yourself from now on.
            Although I wasn't there to witness all your efforts in person, 
            just knowing you, I know you've worked so hard to get where you are today, and I will forever be proud of you.
            And I just know you're going to continue to shine in college and continue to grow into someone that I can be even prouder of
            and love even more.
            <br /><br />
            I've said this once before, but it really feels like I've known you for years,
            probably because the effect you've had on my life, the way you make me feel, and the amount of help and listening you've offered me
            has truly been some of the most special experiences in my life. It's still so hard for me to fathom that such an incredible person
            gave me the chance to be her boyfriend.
            <br /><br />
            With that being said, I realize that there's still a lot I need to learn and do to be the best partner for you.
            And for starters, I want you to know that I'm always just a text or call away. Commmunication is so important to me,
            and I just want you to know that there's not a single thing I want to hide from you. My schedule is a bit packed, but I'm not overexaggerating when I say that you're one of my top priorities in life,
            shoot that text anytime!
            <br /><br />
            I miss you so much already, and these damn couples on campus aren't helping. I believe I may have also mentioned this before,
            you've made me feel ways I've never felt before, and my idiot brain couldn't process that it was love for the longest time.
            Every moment of silence brings my mind straight back to you, and there's nothing I wouldn't do just to spend another day with you.
            Even if that something is going to this dang bummy miserable school, sigh... But seriously, it is so difficult for me to put into words
            how much I love you. Even though we've only really been together for 2 months, there's nothing more that I want to do than spend
            the rest of my life trying to win your heart over and over again.
            <br /><br />
            Remember to take care of yourself as well! Make sure you keep yourself healthy while you're out there learning!
            I know I've been scaring you with my tales of depression, but please please please make the most out of your time in college.
            Regale me with all your tales and adventures, I want to hear everything!


            <br /><br />
            From your boyfriend/nephew/aspiring husband, AC!
